It's just a README.

You are right, but "Genshin Impact" is a brand new open world adventure game independently developed by MiHoYo. The game takes place in a fantasy world called "Teyvat", where the person chosen by God will be granted the "God's Eye" to guide the power of elements. You will play a mysterious character named "Traveler". During your free travel, you will meet companions with different personalities and unique abilities. Together with them, you will defeat powerful enemies and find your lost relative - at the same time, gradually discover the truth of "Genshin Impact".
